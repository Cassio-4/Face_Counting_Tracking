# Face_Counting_Tracking
Benchmarking facial tracking/detection methods
Masters project for face tracking/detection and cropping.

The benchmark folder contains the implementation of different trackers and detectors.
- Detectors implemented: 
  - OpenCV HaarCascade
  
- Trackers implemented:
  - OpenCV multitracker:
    - MedianFlow
    - MIL
    - Boosting
    - TLD
    - KCF
    - GOTURN
    - MOSSE

The counting_test folder has a test implementation of a centroid tracker for ID assignment and a grid for counting.
